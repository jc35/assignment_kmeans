# assignment_kmeans

k_means_jhc.py contains the following 4 functions:

1. k_means(): Naive K-Means algorithm
2. k_means_repeat(): Repeating K-Means algorithm multiple times, since Naive algorithm does not guarantee global optimum. 
3. optimal_k(): Finding optimal K value for given dataset 
4. saving_txt(): Saving textfile containing clustered data points; titled "filename_optimizedK.txt"

For specific details of methods & implementations, please refer to the docstring. 

TestRun.ipynb was run on the provided "0.txt", as well as on 4 very obviously clustered test cases.
